- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- 3 clarifications resolved during `/speckit.clarify` session (2026-03-25): paru pre-installation, JSON output format, date-based image tagging.
- Package list specifics (exact package names) are noted as refinable during implementation per the Jira ticket itself.
